  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at NUS School of Computing, supervised by Prof <a href=" ">Gim hee Lee</a >. 
    I received my B.E. degree from Wuhan University and MEng degree from Nanyang Technology University with a GPA of 5.0/5.0. During my master's study, I was supervised by Prof <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang/">Jiang Xudong</a > and Dr <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/zq">Qian Zheng</a >.
    Currently, my research interests are mainly in 3D computer vision, especially in 3D Assets Generation and Human Digitization, including <strong>Reconstruction</strong> (Neural Fields & 3DGS), <strong>Animation</strong> (Skinning & Rigging), and <strong>Generation</strong> (Diffusion & AR).
