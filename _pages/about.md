## About Me

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at NUS School of Computing, supervised by Prof [Gim hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/). 

I received my B.E. degree from Wuhan University and MEng degree from Nanyang Technology University with a GPA of 5.0/5.0. During my master's study, I was supervised by Prof [Jiang Xudong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang/) and Dr [Qian Zheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zq).

Currently, my research interests are mainly in 3D computer vision, especially in 3D Assets Generation and Human Digitization, including **Reconstruction** (Neural Fields & 3DGS), **Animation** (Skinning & Rigging), and **Generation** (Diffusion & AR).
